# La Finca
La Finca internal optimization program

This software only works for a particular client. However, here you can see I developed a simple web app to import, manage and export information for the client.

The problem-solution it's as follows: the client needed to import a product list generated from their internal management system to an e-commerce system (tiendanube.com). To make this happen, we needed to import every product exported from their internal management system, make some editions and aggregations (additional logic) and then export that product list (.csv file) to a readable one for the e-commerce system.
